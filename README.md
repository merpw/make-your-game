## How to run?

### Start http server in the out directory

Example:

```bash
python -m http.server -d out
```

## How to develop?

### Run http server as before

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run development script to automatically build TypeScript files

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Or Run `npm run build` to build TypeScript files manually

### Code quality tools

#### Run `npm run lint` to check code quality using eslint

#### Run `npm run lint:fix` to fix auto-fixable issues using eslint

#### Run `npm run format` to format code using prettier

It's recommended to run `npm run lint:fix` and `npm run format` before committing
or use extensions for your editor to do it automatically.
